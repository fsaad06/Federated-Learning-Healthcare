# Federated Learning in Healthcare 🏥 using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for Secure Weight Transfer

## 📋 Overview
This project explores the use of **Federated Learning (FL)** in healthcare, focusing on **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** for secure neural network weight transfer between federated nodes. The research highlights enhanced data privacy, reduced inference time, and is currently being prepared for publication.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Data Privacy**: No patient data leaves the local healthcare nodes.
- **Security**: ECC for secure weight transfers in the FL process.
- **Efficiency**: Emphasis on reducing inference time in real-time healthcare applications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Languages**:  
  - C/C++  
  - Python
- **Libraries**:  
  - [Crypto++](https://www.cryptopp.com/): For implementing ECC.  
  - [Flower](https://flower.dev/): For Federated Learning coordination.

## 📊 Results
The project focuses on optimizing:
- **Inference Time**: Faster model predictions.
- **Secure Aggregation**: Efficient and safe weight transfer across nodes.
